# AI Learning Agent System Development Roadmap

## Project Context
This is a personal learning project focused on understanding and developing AI agent systems. The primary goals are:
1. Learning about building and coordinating AI-based software systems
2. Understanding agent-based architectures and their interactions
3. Experimenting with different approaches to AI system development
4. Creating a foundation for future specialized AI agent implementations

This context influences our priorities, focusing on learning and experimentation rather than production-grade features.

## Current Focus: Streaming Implementation
### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Implement streaming for analytical tasks
  - [ ] Add streaming in manager_agent.py
  - [ ] Update WebSocket handling in main.py
  - [ ] Improve frontend response handling
- [ ] Optimize response times and token management
- [ ] Enhance memory management

## System Overview
Building a hierarchical AI agent system for learning and development, starting with a core Manager Agent and gradually expanding to a multi-agent system.
